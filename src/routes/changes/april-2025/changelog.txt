Items on map should show, items in structure should not show on map, items on coordinates/chunks should show in details and map entities, and actions should have see items here action
Worlds should have a world speed that is shown on the worlds page / cards, and I need a firebase function that can run every minute as a baseline and then process transactions for moves, mobilizing groups, gathering
Make mobile, move, gather transaction based and firebase function that happens every minute for each world based on world spee, it should take 1 tick to mobilize a group or move, I need a mobilize, groups tabd, world speed listed on worlds page,
Action to mobile units and player is considered a unit too into unit groups called groups
Details should have units section showing players by units
Add actions popup
If there is no entities at coordinate details can close because legend has all its default text already, so it’s redundant?
Add buildings and items at structure for testing, items saved by playerid and also shared at structure only show own items in the structure
StructureOverview popup that shows items and buildings in the structure and inspect action to open it
Test demobilize with items again
If there are no actions for that coordinate then Actions shouldn’t open when clicking grid

Clicking structure on mapentites should open structure overview at that coordinate like Inspect Structure action does when clicking grid
Mobilisation cant find player due to chunk miscalculation, players are on the correct coordinate tile to spawn, its can’t translate spawn data to?? No, because its looking for player and player is already on the same tile as structure?
MapEntities Minimap should be closed or default closed if spawn menu or welcome open
Move mapentities toggle bottom left near tutorial and mapentities bottom left based too
Are these necessary? lastGroupJoin:1744959989878 lastLocation.timestamp
Demobilise / attack / gather actions shouldn’t be showing when group is moving so they have no available groups
Moving group status text missing from MapEntities but Details has it properly
Yellow idle/pending status colours?
Gather
Move works negative coordinates
Test demobilise
Can demobilize positive but not negative coords, can mobilize negative coords
Demobilize broken again trying to get player back out
Weird sizing for demobilize with items (due to fixed height on Demobilize component 60vh)
StructureOverivew shows item count and storage but doesn’t show shared items or bank items (see backup.json items)
Battles / Fight Error starting battle: HttpsError: No groups found at this location at file:///workspace/actions/attackGroups.mjs:51:13 (same reason as mobilize demobilize move errors chunk key processing floor ) show backup.json
Demobilize with item group select area is too small
Weird worlds card sizing
Add displayName field with join confirmation that can then be used in the layout and user store and displayed in the name, the overcomplicated displayName handling could be removed from gameStore then?

Battles weird text colour code Side 1 and side 2 text the rest is good
Details actions weird background and contrast
Remove explore action
Toggles bottom left look a mess, List icon for entities, Map icon for minimap
Bad contract details close icon
Fighting / Gathering statuses on details inconsistent to Mobilizing / Demobilizing / Moving
Fix demobilize
Overview opens too high up should be at bottom left, remove gap underneath
Rename E entity toggle overview and M minimap toggle to minimap
Move tutorial toggle to container with Minimap toggle
Rename MapEntities Overview
StructureOverview should use race icon and name
Change Structure grid indicator colour to black
MapEntity tabs count badges shouldn’t be faded out when tab is inactive
MapEntity tabs badge for battles isn’t red but blue, groups and players tabs also wrong colours compared to grid entity indicators
StructureOverview doesn’t need to show groups or players
All collapsible sections should include entity indicator color circle to keep reinforcing consistency
Indicator circle colours consistent with MapEntities and grids for all collapsible entity counters Details Overview MapEntities
Details should just have terrain and actions at the top not collapsible without a title since its core information to the tile details is used for
Actions not working properly like Mobilize/Demobilize/Attack/Gather but Inspect Structure works
Details missing terrain info / biome colour square
StructureOverview and Details do not need different tabs the
Actions should be at the bottom of details and not collapsible
Show colour for terrain on tile details
Tile rarity colours in tile details
Remove button on StructureOverview, redundant from misunderstanding
Try move paths drawn to the top left instead of centred in tile

Node circles in path movements are too big and could be strokes and hollow, and the path strokes are too thick too it could all be more elegant
Move doesn’t hide while I draw a path so it obstructs me drawing and confirming my path
Test items In backup.json and demobilize.mjs with StructureOverview showing bank items and shared items when gathering can be tested again (it may already be working but I have no items)
Move Legend further away from right side of screen
StructureOverview should not show items as collapsible it needs to distinguish between bank and shared items at structure (check backup.json
shouldn't AttackGroups JoinBattle Demobilize StructureOveriew Moibilize Details all use targetstore not highlightstore?
The aria warnings may be solved by making wrappers forms instead of divs since cant have buttons inside buttons but can have many buttons inside form AttackGroups, Move, Mobilize, MapEntities, Legend,Grid,Details,Demobilize
Group movement paths stroke line gap animation ends with a jolt and doesn’t repeat seamessly
Path drawing mode styled like Details/Overview and in the bottom centre of map page/screen
Fix move
SpawnMenu needs to be styled like Tutorial/Overview/Details but keep the hover button effect give race icons white fill with :global
WASD movement needs disabling while mobilize is open due to text input or if typing can prevent it
Remove backdrop from details and structure overview
Minimap doesn’t need to close when Overview opens
Overview opens weird/glitchy
Overview doesn’t open smoothly
Unit group statuses should be consistent in details and overview Fighting status should be red, movieg green, mobilizing orange, demobilizing purple, gathering its own colour like status colours in map entities
You/Yours style for groups/player better in Details than Overview
StructureOverview esc should close
Spawn broken

Details should show gather action on any tile for now
Center gather and remove backdrop and unnecessary wrapper
Tile detials opened twice when clicking on grid now this was fixed with StructureOverview
Cant open move
Using Inspect Structure from Details seems to open two copies of StructureOverview
Test gather
Test if possible to make esc key close minimap and overview but would it conflict with esc key to close details and overview?
Clicking inspect structure opens StructureOverview twice
Style attack groups like other modals
AttackGroups doesn’t show
Overview collapsible sections don’t collapse
Clicking structure in Overview doesn’t open StructureOverview like Details can
Yellow you / player indicator which I think is based on game store player info lastPosition for should appear with other indicators in grid tile not in center of tile
Improve modal contrasts
Remove backdrops and unnecessary wrappers from components
JoinBattle bad contrast
Mobilize callable typos, rename Mobilize and Demobilize to s UK spelling
Tile Detials isn’t properly scrollable overflow: auto is fine instead of overflow-y
Tile details core section doesn’t need to be scrollable or have an explicit height
I donlt like side by side dropdown on tutorial think should be more like collapsible in Detials and Overview
Overview collapsible section headers are better than details (sort on the right side when open and hover cursor pointer and collapsed or not indicator)
Active overview tab indicator count should be white with black text
Overview and Details players and groups missing race iconsOverview icon contrast especially for structure / spawn torch needs :global selector fill
You/yours entries for players/groups In Details and Overview should show above other entries that aren’t you or yours and this should be compatible with sorting
		


Shouldn’t game store be subscribed to current worldInfo and always know the spawns SpawnMenu can get them from there
Try show race icon for most dominant race on grid like torch spawn/structure icons
Debug debug from map page looked bad for players
Dual loader is annoying map page
Blue dots on overview / details for entity here should be to the left and center of the item not the text to the left
Move noise to functions/shared and start creating entity configs helpers there so I can reduce the sizes of other files
Close structure overview with escape key
Weird structure/spawn/race icon badge on SpawnMenu
SpawnMenu not showing
Is it race filtering in spawnmenu…?
Join world crashes map page
Spawnmenu “You can explore other areas after spawning” text should be centred
Spawnmenu backdrop should be above overview toggle, its already above brand logo map controls toggles
Spawn option name and coordinates should be on same line “Coordinates:” label is unnecessary it is obvious/implicit
		*HUGE REFACTOR I CANT DOCUMENT IN STEPS
Your player and your groups should be at the top of the section items in Details like that are in Overview
StructureOverview shared and banks should be collapsible sections instead
Mobilise remove backdrop and unnecessary wrapper like Demobilize and make esc key close it
Help button should not be visible if tutorial open
Minimap and Overview icons
Return/recenter map function should use the spawns information from worldInfo and if nothing in map entities and more than 1 chunk away from any of your race spawns button shows up to return you to that spawn via map move target store
Gather/Demobilise/Move/AttackGroups/JoinBattle should preselect the group if it is the only group I have there
Try actions from details fading out or transitioning between each other better
Details hover map conflict fixed

Remove pencil emoji Path: x Points path drawing controls should say PLOT YOUR JOURNEY use the Compass icon
Add Compass icon to move details action
Check alive gets set to false on player works from tick battle processing and include spawnmenu join confirmation and backup
Move component has highlight issue if I highlight somewhere else on the map it closes but Demobilise and Mobilise don’t have that issue?
Test Overview/Details should be higher z index based on which opened first/last, most straightforward solution to this please
Chat doesn’t close elegantly, lot of layout shift
Test mobilise chat logs
Processing on buttons like mobilize to indicate it’s working
Birds for seen/unseen messages
Center legend
AttackGroups bad contrast and should show group races
Test Start of chat and tick handler sends updates battle started, when a player gets killed and who by, maybe can set a cod property (cause of death) and spawning could set it to null again
Check demobilized items saved to structure shared quantities are combined with existing items there that are the same
Add player not joined and not logged in redirects from the map page
Clean backup data, readd world center, move spawns to land
Move all spawns to land, and try world position
clicking on grid should be disabled while spawnmneu is open or spawnmenu's backdrop can just block clicks?
Chat toggle shouldn’t be visible if chat is open, chat toggle shouldn’t. Be disabled if achievements is open but clicking chat toggle should close achievements and clicking achievements toggle should close chat these toggles should never be disabled only not rendered with svelte template ifs please
When spawning it moves me to 0,0, preselecting moves good to target but moves to 0,0 after spawning, if I click on the spawn manually it doesn’t happen?
Achievements drafts
Demobilise should preselect only group

		23 April 2025
		[06:23]LMF:
Chat works like details and overview where it has higher z index if it was active later and hover also sets it to latest active so its above Details/Overview
Bad contrast on join confirmation confirm button, should be like spawn confirm button
JoinConfiriratiom race icons and race names should be flex side by side but sizing is good
Legend over map drawing mode, hide legend when map drawing mode is active
Duplicate chat toggles
Achievements should not be open if spawnmenu is but it should default open unless saves in local storage to default closed like overviews/details
Escape key closes Achievements/Chat too
Test if achievements opens after spawning
Legend shouldn’t be open when inspect structure is
legend and achievements shouldnt be open when tutorial is
Spawn menu use player name from game store
Prevent overview showing up for new users on spawn
Achievements container bottom: -8em; not top %
Achievements don’t show achievements to work towards / locked?
Inspect structure should hide if details opens (again)
Details shouldn’t not be affected by highlighted store only target store svelte 5 runes
Try readding old map start tile delay animations
Center tile background is missing biome or it recalculates unnecessarily when all of the other tiles background/biomes were already figured out?
Messages that I send should not count as unread messages for me
Make minimap hidden by default
Add structure names to the grid
Move spawn: Tile Details (-15,2) Name Boneridge Camp
Fix center tile colour

Remove gold border for player on Grid tile
Remove yellow current player indicator from grid
YouAreHere stops showing when mobilized
YouAreHere should be smaller when no structure on the tile
Improve player lastPosition entering without breaking load by coordinate and world center loading
JoinBattle says no groups on that tile I can attack because their status is fighting?
Demobilize action shows when no structure on the tile but inspect knows not to
New force should be named player’s force by default
Mobilise bad contrast
Structure icons on grid should be dark not lighht Torch and Structure icon
Try Movement paths draw from nearest corner to where they are heading but never from the bottom right corner of the tile it’s coming from or to the bottom right of the target tile
Remove redundant arrow in movement path drawing lines
Gathering and demobilize statuses are the same colour in Details and Overview?
Details component group and player entity statuses should be on the left near units count like Overview
Resume button and join world should use lastLocation from game store otherwise YouAreHere indicator doesn’t work? And world joinconfirmation but refreshing makes it work again?
Grid tiles not revealing transition-delay based on distance, background colour should start transparent
Cleanup database and retest battles

Move action icon larger than other action icons, inconsistent
Close button shows up late compared to other actions
Use target indicator for highlight and call it highlight indicator, remove target cell border
Don’t show movement paths, tile structures or indicators until initial grid tiles transition has finished and movement is allowed again, related: stop target tile showing so early, doesn’t fit in with other tiles transitioning in based on distance
Check combat quests work
Monster groups don’t seem to attack and start batltes with player groups?
Player doesn’t die in battles to respawn and battles seem to continue going with no units/groups with units on one side?
		



Can’t mobilize via new Peek menu
No gather action?
Attack structure and check compatibility with battle tick
Able to leave battles “fleeing” that lets them out of the battle after next tick is processed and ends the battle if there is a side with no groups now in it after handling fleeing groups
Ability to cancel moves
Recruitment tick
Does recruitment ever show?
spawn NPC randomly relatively near where players are already monster groups with items, reference gather, can merge them together spawn in an existing monster group if one is already on the tile chosen already so they can grow bigger over time if not killed
Test attacking groups/structures
StructureOverview should show the buildings for the structure and each structure can be upgraded and the overall structure level can be derived form its built and upgraded buildings within the structure?
Fix peek opening crafting and Peek crafting action colour make it pink
Simplify crafting recipes until we get shared repo
Crafting menu wherever player is if at structure then can craft more leveraging the structure’s building levels
Structure overview should show structure’s buildings that arent built or upgraded yet so they can start to be upgraded from shared resources
Some crafting items should be dependent on the structure’s buildings levels are at due to upgrade



Move should have chat message
Add monster icon if that’s dominant on tile
Notices only show when chat open
No chat message for starting gathering
No demobilise chat message
Gathering no groups, Mobilise no gorups
Test spawn/join world
Shouldn’t show upgrade structure or build now buttons at a spawn structure that isnt your race a building you don’t own or if your player isn’t at that tile or in a group at that tile
Crafting should be done in terms of ticks instead of time
Peek can show craft action anywhere player is (in group or at structure demobilised) Player can craft anywhere but some items need to be at structure with its building levels, Should be able to craft wherever player is but it’s enhanced by the structure
Show recruit action on Peek when player at structure not in a group
Shows 0 players on world
Fix monster icon and make it red
Add horn to recruit actions
Need recruit icon
Spawned monster groups can join existing battles on a random side
Spawned monster groups should sometimes build/upgrade their own structure, if they have items in their group they should try to go back to their nearest structure to demobilise into shared storage so they can also upgrade
monster spawned groups should combine with other monster groups and the name changes based on size of monster hoard, when they combine they should add a few more units too, they get a boost from not being cleaned up like that, and also give them more items to make them more rewarding
monster spawns should move towards closest structure one tile at a time and they should attack groups and structures if they are on the same tile,
Upgrade structure button unstyled in StructureOverview
Should be able to attack groups that are gathering and it interrupts their status - it already sets fighting status?
